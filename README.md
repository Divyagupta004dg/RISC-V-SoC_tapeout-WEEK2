## **RISC-V-SoC_tapeout-WEEK2**

*VSDBabySoC is an open-source System-on-Chip (SoC) built using Sky130 technology, integrating digital and analog components on a single chip. It is based on the RVMYTH RISC-V processor core, combined with a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for stable clock generation and a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for real-world interfacing. The SoC demonstrates how digital computation, precise timing, and analog conversion work together to create a compact and efficient system.*

## VSDBabySoC ‚Äì RISC-V Based System on Chip (SoC) Design

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a compact, open-source System on Chip (SoC) using the RVMYTH (RISC-V) processor core.

The SoC integrates:

Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) ‚Üí for precise clock generation and synchronization

10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) ‚Üí for digital-to-analog interfacing (audio/video output)

üè∑Ô∏è The SoC (fabricated using Sky130 technology) demonstrates digital + analog integration ‚Äî a key skill for modern chip designers.

It serves as an educational and experimental platform for SoC design, clock management, and analog interfacing.

## Understanding System on Chip (SoC)

A System on Chip (SoC) is like a complete computer on a single silicon chip.
It combines multiple components that earlier existed separately on boards.

üîπ Main Components

- CPU (RVMYTH ‚Äì RISC-V Core) ‚Üí Main processing brain

- Memory (RAM/ROM) ‚Üí Data storage and program execution

- I/O Interfaces ‚Üí Connects to peripherals (UART, SPI, GPIO, etc.)

- GPU / DSP ‚Üí Handles graphics, audio/video signal processing

- Power Management ‚Üí Controls voltage and power domains

- Analog Blocks ‚Üí PLL, DAC/ADC for real-world interfacing

## Why SoCs are Important

- High performance ‚Äì tightly integrated data flow

- Low power ‚Äì small distances ‚Üí less power loss

- Cost-effective ‚Äì one chip instead of multiple boards

- Compact ‚Äì perfect for mobile, IoT, and wearable systems

- Reliable ‚Äì fewer connections = fewer failure points

 ## Types of SoCs

| **Type** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Microcontroller-based SoC** | Low power, simple control tasks | IoT sensors, appliances |
| **Microprocessor-based SoC** | High performance, can run OS | Smartphones, tablets |
| **Application-specific SoC (ASIC)** | Custom optimized for one use | GPUs, AI accelerators |

## VSDBabySoC Architecture

**VSDBabySoC** = *RVMYTH (RISC-V CPU) + 8x PLL + 10-bit DAC*

üî∏**1. Initialization & Clock Generation**

Input signal activates PLL

PLL locks and generates a stable, synchronized clock

Keeps RVMYTH and DAC perfectly timed

üîñ Prevents data corruption due to mismatched clocks

üî∏**2. Data Processing (RVMYTH)**

The RVMYTH core executes instructions

Uses r17 register to hold and cycle values

Sends digital data continuously to DAC for analog conversion

üî∏**3. Analog Output (DAC)**

The 10-bit DAC converts digital data ‚Üí analog signal

Output (saved as OUT) can drive TVs, speakers, etc.

üîñ Demonstrates digital-to-analog communication in real applications

## Key Components Explained

*1 Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)*

Synchronizes output phase/frequency with input reference

Components:

- Phase Detector ‚Äì compares input vs. feedback phase

- Loop Filter ‚Äì smooths error signal

- VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) ‚Äì adjusts frequency

**Why PLL is needed:**

- Off-chip clocks have delay, jitter, and frequency errors (ppm)

- On-chip PLL provides precise & stable clocks

*2 Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)*

Converts binary (digital) data ‚Üí continuous analog signal

Common DAC types:

- Weighted Resistor DAC

- R-2R Ladder DAC (used in BabySoC)

- In VSDBabySoC ‚Üí 10-bit DAC ‚Üí 1/1024 analog precision
