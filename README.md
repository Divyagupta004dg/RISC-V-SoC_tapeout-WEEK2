# RISC-V-SoC_tapeout-WEEK2

***VSDBabySoC is an open-source System-on-Chip (SoC) built using Sky130 technology, integrating digital and analog components on a single chip. It is based on the RVMYTH RISC-V processor core, combined with a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for stable clock generation and a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for real-world interfacing. The SoC demonstrates how digital computation, precise timing, and analog conversion work together to create a compact and efficient system.***
